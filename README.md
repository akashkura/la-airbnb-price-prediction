# Airbnb Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts Airbnb listing prices in Los Angeles using a machine learning model. The project leverages features like location (longitude, latitude), amenities, and room type to train and evaluate models, including a Random Forest Regressor and a Linear Regression model.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and removing outliers to ensure robust model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the price distribution and geographic distribution of listings.
- **Machine Learning**: Building a Random Forest Regressor for accurate price predictions.
- **Visualization**: Insights into data trends through various charts and plots.
